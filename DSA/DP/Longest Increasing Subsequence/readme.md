## Problem 3: Longest Increasing Subsequence
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
```
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.


### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
